# flower_plot
R script to generate a capsule-style flower plot showing intersections at three levels: (1) shared by all, (2) shared by â‰¥2 samples, and (3) unique. A clear alternative to Venn/UpSet plots, designed for pangenome summaries; supports grouped petals, scalable palettes, and adaptive radius.
